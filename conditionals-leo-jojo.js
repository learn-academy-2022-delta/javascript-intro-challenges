Write a statement that takes a variable of item and logs "in budget" if a price is $100 or less.
Write a statement that takes a variable of hungry and logs "eat food" if you are hungry and "keep coding" if you are not hungry.
Write a statement that takes a variable of trafficLight and logs "go" if the light is green, "slow down" if the light is yellow and "stop" if the light is red.
Write a statement that takes two variables that are numbers and outputs the larger number. If the numbers are equal, output "the numbers are the same".
